## Goals

In this case, you will break down and quantify a business problem, focusing on tasks like:

1. Identifying and thinking about trade-offs.
2. Calculating costs of several inputs (e.g., materials, labor, assets, property).
3. Thinking in common units of measurement (e.g., cost per square foot or cost per week).
4. Identifying the break-even point when investing in new technology.
5. Communicating your findings effectively by addressing the key performance indicators that matter.

**Business Context.** You are an analyst at a wholesale distribution company that imports housewares in bulk and mails them out to individuals. Being environmentally conscious, your boss wants to reduce the amount of waste in your distribution process, specifically waste from packaging materials. However, your boss is looking for a way to reduce waste at _no extra cost_. The company imports products and often has excess cardboard material, so you suggest converting the excess cardboard into a more environmentally friendly packaging material using a [cardboard perforator](https://www.abe-online.com/intimus-pacmaster-cardboard-shredder). Your boss thinks this could work but needs to know how much it will cost. You have been asked to account for all the inputs and changes in the business processes so that an informed decision can be made.

**Business Problem.** You will need to quantify all the current business inputs and calculate the financial cost or benefit of implementing this waste reduction strategy.

**Analytical Context.** All the information that you require will be provided as we go through this case. You will need to use the given information to come to an informed decision on how to proceed with the proposed initiative.
